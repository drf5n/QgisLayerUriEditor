Your plugin drfLayerSourceEditor was created in:
    /Users/drf/Repositories/QgisLayerUriEditor/drfLayerSourceEditor

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    /Users/drf/.qgis2/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc4

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``layer_source_editor.py``

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

  * Modify your user interface by opening drfLayerSourceEditor.ui in Qt Designer
